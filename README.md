This repository demonstrates a common type coercion issue in JavaScript. The `myFunction` adds a number and a string, resulting in string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using explicit type checking or conversion to avoid this issue.  This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to track down, and this example helps in illustrating the problem and its resolution.
